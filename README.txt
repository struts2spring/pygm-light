INTRO
=====
This is a very minimal GraphicsMagick binding.
Probably more of a "binding construction kit".
I just created it for my own purposes.

Requires ctypesgen:

If you need more mature Python GraphicsMagick binding, go for:

HOW DOES IT WORK
================
You can try to use the pregenerated file "gm_wrap.py", generated using GraphicsMagick 1.3.12 on Linux Mint 10 (64-bit).
But it covers NOT ALL of API methods.

You can regenerate your own version using the generator script.
Headers from GM 1.3.12 are included.
Parsing C headers, especially ones from GM, is a nightmare.
ctypesgen does its best, but I've had to help it by patching all common dependencies into each .h file.
Patching is done on the fly by the script, so feel free to substitute vanilla .h files from your distribution.
Oh, and, by the way - magick_config.h file is not from standard source distribution, it's generated by configure (autotools).
You can fetch it from source package of your distro (libgraphicsmagick1-dev on Ubuntu-based linuxes).

Generator will probably work only on Linux (requires GCC?)
